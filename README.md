# DictationBattle

DictationBattle is an interactive English learning platform that combines traditional memorization with modern Web3 technology. The platform allows users to participate in team-based challenges, where they can compete to memorize and dictate English short texts. The key features of the platform include:

## Key Features

- **Team Challenges (Battles)**: Users can initiate a Battle, defining key parameters such as recruitment period, start and end times, and an entry fee. 
- **Entry Fee and Prize Pool**: Participants contribute an entry fee that goes into a shared prize pool. The more a user contributes, the larger their share of the prize pool at the end.
- **Daily Tasks**: Once the Battle begins, participants must complete daily tasks (memorizing and dictating English texts). Completion of these tasks is required for users to qualify for the prize distribution.
- **Prize Distribution**: After the Battle ends, the prize pool is distributed among the participants who completed all daily tasks. The distribution is proportional to the amount contributed to the prize pool.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

- **Frontend**: The user interface of the website where users can view, join, and manage their Battles. This section handles all interactions, including task tracking, payment, and participation details.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic that handles user data, Battle creation, task management, and payment processing.
- **Smart Contracts**: The on-chain logic responsible for Battle creation, fee management, and prize pool distribution. It ensures transparency and security for all participants.
